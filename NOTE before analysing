> These steps use the qiime2 amplicon analysis pipeline on HPC. Please make sure you have the (qiiime2-amplicon) conda installed before commencing.
> This pipeline can be used on 16S and/or ITS amplicon data.
> Make sure you have your data uploaded to the correct location on cluster and run the codes from appropriate directory.
> The data must be uploaded in correct FASTQ format, for valid data types please check qiime2 website (https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/tutorials/importing/#sequence-data-with-sequence-quality-information-i-e-fastq).
> The current analysis uses Casava 1.8 paired-end demultiplexed fastq sequences as import type.
> Please also make sure you have the sample metadata uploaded to the cluster in .txt format (can also be .csv or .tsv) as this is helpful in downstream analysis.
